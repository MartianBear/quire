## Mapping out your publication

The project that loads when running `quire new` is a good place to start your own project. You can copy and paste over the information in the files there, or delete all the files and start fresh. Either way, a good first step is to create an outline of your publication that maps out what each page/chapter will be and in what oder.

Introduction
Chapter 1
Chapter 2
Chapter 3
Conclusion
Credits

For each of these, you’ll want to create a Markdown file (.md) inside the `content` directory of your project. The filenames you use will create the URLs of your book, so never use spaces or special characters, and lowercase letters are generally best.
