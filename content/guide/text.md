## Structuring Your Publication

The way you organize the pages Markdown files in the `content` directory of your project defines the structure of your publication. The names of the files will effect the final URLs of your publication as well as how the *Table of Contents* is organized. By default, URLs will be the filename, minus the `.md` suffix. Files nested in a sub-directory within `content` will include that sub-directory in the URL as well. So if your site is mypublication.com, these files:

```
üìÑ cover.md
üìÑ contents.md
üìÅ part-one
  üìÑ section-overview.md
  üìÑ chapter-01.md
  üìÑ chapter-02.md
üìÅ part-two
  üìÑ section-overview.md
  üìÑ chapter-03.md
```

Will map to these URLs:

```
mypublication.com/cover/
mypublication.com/contents/
mypublication.com/part-one/section-overview/
mypublication.com/part-one/chapter-01/
mypublication.com/part-one/chapter-02/
mypublication.com/part-two/section-overview/
mypublication.com/part-two/chapter-03/
```

[note/tip] There are some important rules and tips to keep in mind, as well as further ways of refining and customizing the organization of your publication content:

1. Filenames should be lowercase, with no spaces or special characters.

2. Sub-directories can‚Äôt have other sub-directories within them.

3. Don't use `index.md` or `_index.md` files.

  For users with previous Hugo, static-site or other web development experience, you should not use `index.md` or `_index.md` files in your Quire project. `_index.md` is a Hugo convention for creating sections and nested sections, but in Quire it works against the linear ordering of the publication and breaks the *Next* and *Previous* page navigation. `index.md` is a web convention, but in Hugo, the presence of an `index.md` file in any directory converts that directory into a so-called ‚Äúpage bundle‚Äù in Hugo‚Äôs eyes and none of the other pages in that directory will be rendered.

4. Create homepage and section landing pages with `slug`.

  `index.md` files would typically be used to create pages with URLs at the root level of the directory including the homepage of your site and sub-directories (like `mypublication.com/` and `mypublication.com/part-one/`). Because `index.md` files can‚Äôt be used, you can instead define a `slug` attribute with a value of `.` (a period) in the page YAML of the page/file you want to use as a landing or homepage. You should add one `slug` attribute with a value of `.` per section. Read more about how to use `slug` to [create section landing pages](#creating-section-landing-pages) in the below section.

5. Control page ordering with `weight`.

  In the example above, we‚Äôve listed the files and directories in the order they would appear in the publication. When looking in the actual `content` directory, however, they will almost certainly not appear in the proper publication order, but rather more likely, they‚Äôd appear alphabetically. To control page ordering in Quire, define a `weight` attribute, with a numerical value, in the page YAML.

## Defining Your Page‚Äôs Configuration and Metadata

Every page in a Quire publication starts with a block of YAML (discussed further in the [*Publication Configuration & Metadata*](metadata.md) page of this guide). The three core attributes you‚Äôre probably going to define on every page are `title`, `type`, and `weight`. All page YAML, no matter how many attributes it has, goes between a set of three dashes, at the very top of the page.

```yaml
---
title:
type:
weight:
---
```

The page `type` must be one of nine possible values: `page`, `essay`, `entry`, `cover`, `contents`, `about`, `search`, or `data`. If left blank, or if any other value besides these nine is entered, the `type` will default to "page". Read more about the specific `type`s in the [Defining Page Types](#defining-page-types) section below.

The page `weight` is a number and will determine the order in which the page appears in the publication. The first page in your publication would be `weight: 1` (don‚Äôt start with zero 0), the second would be `weight: 2`, and so on. Numbering should be unique, and sequential whole numbers, but it can skip numbers. So, if there‚Äôs no page with `weight: 3`, Quire will proceed to look for the next number. Intentionally skipping numbers in your sequence can be useful to leave room for adding content later. For example, your frontmatter might start at "0", your first section might be "100", second section "200" and so on. This makes it much easier to add a page to an early part of your publication, without renumbering every subsequent page.

When you need to add more page information, the complete list of options is available in the ["YAML"](../api-docs/yaml.md) section of the guide.


## Defining Page Types

Every page has one of the following nine `type`s. If none is specified, Quire defaults to `type: page`.

`page`: The default value. A general publication page. Used for introductions, forewords, chapters, appendices and other pages.

`essay`: Meant to be a standalone, self-contained article in a periodical or collected volume. The `essay` page type will typically include the contributor names and potentially bios, its own bibliography, and an abstract. This is also reflected in the metadata embedded in the page as well, which will describe the page more specifically and with more page-specific information than a typical publication page, whose metadata will instead point to the publication as a whole.

`entry`: An entry in a catalogue of objects. Typically includes a large, zoomable image of the object, with a table of object details and narrative text. You can learn more about entries in the [*Catalogues* page](content/guide/collection-catalogues)of this guide

`cover`: The cover of your publications. Typically a full-screen splash page with large title, with cover description and publication information below. Along with defining `type: cover`, you will usually want to also add `slug: .` so that the cover page URL is the base URL of your site (your homepage). You can find more details about how to use `slug` in [Creating section landing pages](#creating-section-landing-pages) below.

`contents`: Automatically creates a table of contents for your entire publication, or for a section of your publication when used inside a sub-directory. The `tocType` can be set to either `full` or `short` in the publication‚Äôs `config.yml` file. The `full` option will typically list and link to all main pages, sections and section pages. The `short` option will list and link to main pages and sections only, not the pages within the section. The `contents` page type can also be customized with four classes: `brief`, `list`, `abstract`, or `grid`.

`about`: The about page will typically include the publication description, citation information, revision history, downloads and other formats, copyright and license information and more. This can be used also for a traditional copyright page for the PDF output format.

`data`: Description TK

`search`: Description TK


## Creating Section Landing Pages

A Quire publication can have sub-sections, created by nesting a group of one or more pages inside a sub-directory within the main `content` directory. It is recommended (though not required) to designate one of the pages in each sub-directory section to be the section landing page. To do so, add `slug: .` to the page YAML block. The `slug` attribute overrides the default name to be used in the URL for the page, and the period `.` refers it back to the sub-directory name. So, if in your site `mypublication.com` you have sub-directory called `part-one` and in that a landing page called `landing-page.md`, instead of the URL being `mypublication.com/part-one/landing-page/`, it would be `mypublication.com/part-one/`. Here‚Äôs the YAML:

```yaml
title: Part One
type: contents
class: grid
slug: .
```

The `title` of your defined landing page is what will be used in the header of that page, and in the *Table of Contents* and menu of your site.

However, the filename of the sub-directory itself is also used in your publication; for the online navigation bar, and in the running page footers of the PDF version. In these two places, Quire takes the sub-directory filename and humanizes it, which means to change hyphens into spaces and capitalize with title case. So, the sub-directory `part-one` becomes ‚ÄúPart One‚Äù, or `sculpture-of-the-renaissance` becomes ‚ÄúSculpture of the Renaissance.‚Äù

## Displaying your Pages

By default, every page you create will be included in all formats of your publication (online, PDF/print, and e-book) and will automatically be listed in the publication‚Äôs menu and *Table of Contents*. However, this can be overridden by setting any of the following attributes under `display` in the page YAML to `false`:

```yaml
display:
  online:
  menu:
  pdf_ebook:
  toc:
```

[note]Note that when setting `online: false`, the page will not be included in the linear ordering of the book or in the menu, table of contents or search index, but it is still built. When deploying your site from the built files in the `public/` directory, simply delete any unneeded ones. Read [more about site deployment](output.md) in the chapter on *Multi-Format Output*.

## Formatting Text Content with Markdown

The main content of your page appears after the YAML block at the top, and will be formatted in Markdown. Markdown is a very simple, plain text markup language that uses a few text rules to structure content for easy conversion into HTML. For example, a hash or pound sign at the beginning of a line makes a heading, and asterisks wrapping text turns it italic. You can learn more about Markdown syntax in the *Markdown fundamentals* page of this guide.

## Using Shortcodes to Add Features

Quire adds a number of specialty shortcodes which extend the functionality and possibilities of plain text markup. While Hugo[&] has a number of built-in shortcodes, which can also work in Quire, Quire-specific shortcodes always start with a `q`.

Shortcodes are always formatted with a combination of curly brackets and angle brackets, with the name of the shortcode inside (`{{< shortcode >}}`) and often with some additional information in quotes. The example below inserts a figure in your document, matching a corresponding `id` with figure information stored in the publication‚Äôs `figures.yml` file.

```
{{< q-figure id="3.1" >}}
```

While most Quire shortcodes work like `q-figure` as a single instance, some shortcodes act as wrappers around other text and so appear in pairs, with the second of the pair having a slash `/` preceding the shortcode name, much like you‚Äôd find in HTML markup.

```
{{< q-class "backmatter" >}}Text goes here{{< /q-class >}}

```

The following shortcode are (or will be) available in Quire. You‚Äôll find more about them in their respective sections of the guide, as well as in the [shortcodes api reference](../api-docs/shortcodes.md).


- [`q-class`](#): Wrapping text in this shortcode will allow you to apply a class name to that block of text, which can then be used to apply custom css styles or interactions as needed.
- [`q-bibliography`](bibliographies.md): Generates a bibliography from the entries in the project's `bibiliography.yml` file.
- [`q-cite`](bibliographies.md): Adds a linked Author Date citation reference to the text, and a hover pop-up with the full citation text. It also adds the citation to a map of cited works, which can then be output as a page-level bibliography on essay and entry type pages.
- [`q-contributors`](contributors.md): Can be used to create a page of contributor biographies, a section of bios for a single page, a simple list of contributors, a byline for a particular page, or other similar outputs.
- [`q-figure`](figures.md): Inserts a formatted figure image (including audio and video) and caption using data from the project‚Äôs `figures.yml` file, or from values supplied directly in the shortcode.
- [`q-figure-group`](figures.md): Like `q-figure`, but with handling for multiple images at once.
- [`q-link-list`](copyright.md): Creates an unordered list of links. Makes use of the `link-list.html` partial in the site templates.
